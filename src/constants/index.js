export const HERO_CONTENT = `I'm a passionate and adaptable developer with experience across the full stack and a growing expertise in AI and data science. I specialize in building robust and scalable web applications using modern frameworks like React, Next.js, Node.js, and databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

Beyond full stack development, I actively work on cutting-edge Generative AI projects, including LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and intelligent chatbot development. My journey has expanded into data science and machine learning, allowing me to craft AI-driven solutions that enhance user experiences and solve real-world problems.

Whether it's building APIs, creating ML pipelines, or integrating intelligent systems into applications, I enjoy bridging the gap between traditional development and the future of AI.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
  I’m a curious, versatile, and self-driven developer who thrives at the intersection of software engineering and AI innovation. My background in full stack web development forms the foundation of my approach to solving problems—clean architecture, strong UI/UX, and scalable backends.

Recently, I’ve been immersed in building LLM-powered applications using RAG architecture, prompt engineering, and extracting structured data from unstructured sources. I’ve also explored data science and machine learning through internships and personal projects, applying statistical and ML techniques to derive meaningful insights from complex data.

I'm always eager to collaborate, contribute to open-source, and stay ahead in a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Outside of code, you'll find me exploring AI research, participating in hackathons, and sharing knowledge with the tech community.
